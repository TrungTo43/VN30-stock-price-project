# VN30 stock price project (2019-2021)

In this project, I crawled the stock price data of VN30 companies (updated on Sep 2022) using the vnquant library of Mr. Pham Dinh Khanh (https://github.com/phamdinhkhanh/vnquant). After that, I used this dataset to apply the clustering algorithm to divide 30 listed companies in VN30 into 2 groups of stock.
