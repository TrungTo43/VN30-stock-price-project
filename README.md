# VN30 stock price project (2019-2021)

In this project, I crawled the stock price data of VN30 companies (updated on Sep 2022) using the vnquant library of Mr. Pham Dinh Khanh (https://github.com/phamdinhkhanh/vnquant). After that, I applied the clustering algorithm to this dataset to classify 30 listed companies in VN30 into two clusters.

1. Introduction

    The study applies the stock classification algorithm to VN30 companies listed on the stock exchange. The study serves the purpose of classifying stocks by group and supporting investors for more accurate stock evaluation. 
    
    The data collection period of this study is from 2019-2021 (including the time before and during the COVID-19 epidemic). Although I wants to collect data in 2022 (because it is the time after the COVID-19 epidemic), the data of 2022 up to the time of completion of the study is incomplete. Therefore, the data of stock price in 2022 will not be crawled.
    
    Questions to answer: How many groups of stocks can be classified from the stock price of VN30 companies?

4. Conclusion and improvement

    4.1 Conclusion 
    
    There are two groups of stock price: 
    
    - Financial-related companies
    - Service-providing and manufacturing companies
    
    4.2 Improvement
    
    The research is done by a fresher Data Analyst, so it may not be complete and professional incomparison with the expert's study in the Data industry.
    
    The study will be supplemented with data in 2022 once this data is available.
